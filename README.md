# Shopping List ðŸ“‹

## Overview
- I have started to learn React, and this project is a demonstration of my learning process. It includes components and uses core React hooks like `useState` and `useEffect`. The **Shopping List** app allows users to add, edit, and delete items, providing a simple and interactive experience for managing a shopping list.

### Features
- **Add Items**: Quickly add new items to the shopping list.
- **Edit Items**: Modify existing items in the list.
- **Delete Items**: Remove items from the list when no longer needed.
- **React Hooks**: Utilizes React hooks like `useState` for managing state.
- **Local State Management**: Keeps everything managed locally for fast performance.

## Technologies Used
- React: For building the user interface.
- JavaScript (ES6+): Core language for building components and managing logic.
- HTML/CSS: For structuring and styling the app.
- Node.js & npm: For managing dependencies and running the development environment.

## Usage
- **Add Item**: Use the input field to type an item name and click the "Add" button. The item will appear in the shopping list.
- **Edit Item**: Click the "Edit" button next to any item to modify its name. After editing, press "Save" to update the item.
- **Delete Item**: Click the "Delete" button next to an item to remove it from the list.

    item.id === id ? updatedItem : item
  );
